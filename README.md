# pycodestyle_magic
Magic function for pycodestyle module in Jupyter-Lab or Databricks Notebook

# installation
Make sure you've the Python package `pycodestyle`, and this `lintersmagic`.

```
pip install lintersmagic
```

# usage
Enable the magic function by using the lintersmagic module in a cell

`%load_ext lintersmagic`

## to check a cell once:
use the function as first line in your cell to check compliance with `pycodestyle` as such:

`%%pycodestyle`

## to auto check each cell:
If you want this compliance checking turned on by default for each cell then run this magic line function in an empty cell:

`%pycodestyle_on`

You only need to call this once (observe the single `%`).

To turn off the auto-checking for each cell use:

`%pycodestyle_off`


## config options for `%pycodestyle_on` (version >= 0.5)

1. The option `--ignore` or `-i` will add the the named error(s) to the ignore list

Example to ignore the errors `E225` and `E265`:
```
%pycodestyle_on --ignore E225,E265
``` 
Remember to _avoid_ spaces between declaring multiple errors.

2. With the option `--max_line_length` or `-m` the max-line-length can be customised.

Example to set the line length to `119` characters instead of the default `79`:
```
%pycodestyle_on --max_line_length 119
```

The options can be combined as well.
